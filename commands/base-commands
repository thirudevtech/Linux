ls : listing directories
pwd : present working directory
cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory
mkdir — Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory.
rmdir — Use rmdir to delete a directory. But rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory.
rm - Use the rm command to delete files and directories.  Use "rm -r" to delete just the directory. It deletes both the folder and the files it contains when using only the rm command.
touch — The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty zip file. For example, “touch new.txt”.
man & --help — To know more about a command and how to use it, use the man command. It shows the manual pages of the command. For example, “man cd”
cp — Use the cp command to copy files through the command line. It takes two arguments: The first is the location of the file to be copied, the second is where to copy.
mv — Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a file. For example, if we want to rename the file “text” to “new”, we can use “mv text new”.
locate — The locate command is used to locate a file in a Linux system, just like the search command in Windows. This command is useful when you don't know where a file is saved or the actual name of the file.
